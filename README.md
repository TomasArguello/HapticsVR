# HapticsVR
An application that acts as a training simulation for nursing students to practice the Leopold Procedure on a virtual patient. This application was used as part of a Thesis for a Masters student at Texas A&amp;M University, developed through the Soft Interaction Lab. 
There are three different controller layouts, each with their unique form of haptics feedback. The Thesis focused on finding out which controller layout worked best to simulate the Leopold Procedure, since the procedure requires a nurse to feel the belly of a pregnant woman. The three controller layouts were the normal Vive controllers, a pair of SenseGlove controllers and custom built hardware that simulates palpation on the palms of the user. The custom built hardware was built by me and C++ was used to code the communication between the hardware and the computer running the application.
