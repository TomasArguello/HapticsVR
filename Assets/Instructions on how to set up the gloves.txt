INSTRUCTIONS ON SETTING UP THE GLOVES
First connect everything that needs to be connected. The linkbox, the wires, the Vive tracker, etc. 
Then once everything is connected, make sure that the Vive tracker is actually connected. 
Pair the Vive Tracker with SteamVR if needed. 
Go to the Unity project, open it, then click on Window > SteamVR Input.
Click on "Open Binding UI", which is normally on the lower right.
It will open a SteamVR window, and will go to the controller select screen after a few seconds. 
Select the Vive Tracker in Hand option.
Then select the "Saved [Testing] haptic configuration for Vive Tracker in Hand" binding.
Exit the SteamVR controller select window after that. 
Then click "Save and generate" option in the lower left(?).
After that, it should be good to go. 
REMEMBER, check the "Controller (left)" and "Controller (right)" and see if the Transform component is moving 
when the Editor is in Play mode. If it is not, change the Index variable of the "Steam VR_Tracked Object" script
component until you see the hands in Play.
